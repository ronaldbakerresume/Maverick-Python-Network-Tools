## Description

This script intercepts DNS queries on the local network and responds with spoofed DNS answers for a specific domain,  
effectively redirecting clients to a chosen IP address.  

## Requirements

- Python 3  
- **scapy** (install with `pip install scapy`)  
- **Superuser privileges** (to capture and send DNS packets on UDP port 53)

## Usage

1. **Run** with superuser privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 dns_spoofing_tool.py
   ```
2. Provide:
   - **Target domain** to spoof (e.g., `example.com`)
   - **Spoofed IP address** to map the domain to (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
3. **Configure** your network or devices to use this machineâ€™s IP as their DNS server (or intercept/forward DNS traffic to port 53).
4. When a DNS query for the target domain is intercepted, the script replies with the spoofed IP.

Example session:
```
