# DNS Tools

Here youâ€™ll find scripts for DNS lookups, logging, spoofing, and interception. They help explore or manipulate how domain name resolution occurs.

## Subdirectories

- [dns_lookup/](./dns_lookup/)  
  Performs DNS queries (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, etc.) for different hostnames.

- [dns_query_logger/](./dns_query_logger/)  
  Logs DNS queries on the network for auditing or investigative purposes.

- [dns_request_interceptor/](./dns_request_interceptor/)  
  Intercepts DNS requests in real time, offering the ability to inspect or modify responses.

- [dns_spoofing_detection/](./dns_spoofing_detection/)  
  Identifies potential DNS spoofing or cache poisoning attacks by comparing expected vs. actual DNS replies.

- [dns_spoofing_tool/](./dns_spoofing_tool/)  
  Facilitates DNS spoofing to redirect traffic for penetration testing or educational demonstrations.
