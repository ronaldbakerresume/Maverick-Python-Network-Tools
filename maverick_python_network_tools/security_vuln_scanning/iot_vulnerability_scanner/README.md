# IoT Device Vulnerability Scanner

**Developer**: Ronald Baker  

## Description

This script scans a local network for IoT devices and checks for basic vulnerabilities, including:
- **Open ports** (e.g., SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
- **Default credentials** (using a username:password wordlist)
- Potential **firmware version** issues (if accessible, you can extend the script for this)

## Requirements

- **Python 3**
- **scapy** (`pip install scapy`)
- **socket** (part of the standard library)
- **Superuser privileges** (to perform network scanning with scapy)

## Usage

1. **Run** with superuser privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 iot_vulnerability_scanner.py
   ```
2. **Enter**:
   - **Network range** (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
   - **Path** to a wordlist file (e.g., `wordlist.txt`), containing username:password pairs (one pair per line)
3. The script:
   - **Discovers** devices on the specified network (using ARP requests)
   - **Scans** each device for open ports (defaults to ports 22, 80, 443)
   - **Checks** for default credentials using the provided wordlist

### Example

```
Welcome to the IoT Device Vulnerability Scanner.
Developer: Ronald Baker

Enter the target network range (e.g., '192.168.1.0/24'): 192.168.1.0/24
Enter the path to the wordlist file (e.g., 'wordlist.txt'): wordlist.txt
Scanning the network: 192.168.1.0/24
Discovered 2 device(s):
- IP: 192.168.1.10, MAC: 00:11:22:33:44:55
- IP: 192.168.1.20, MAC: 66:77:88:99:AA:BB

Scanning ports for 192.168.1.10...
Open ports for 192.168.1.10: [22, 80]
Checking credentials for 192.168.1.10:22...
Trying admin/admin...
Valid credentials found for 192.168.1.10:22 -> admin/admin

Scanning ports for 192.168.1.20...
Open ports for 192.168.1.20: [80]
Checking credentials for 192.168.1.20:80...
Trying admin/admin...
No valid credentials found.
```

You can **modify** the port list, network timeout, or credentials check to suit your environment.  
You can also **extend** the script to detect firmware versions or other IoT-specific vulnerabilities.
