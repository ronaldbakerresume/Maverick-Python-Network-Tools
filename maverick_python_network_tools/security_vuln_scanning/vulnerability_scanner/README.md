# Vulnerability Scanner Framework

**Developer**: Ronald Baker  

## Description

This script scans a target web application for common **vulnerabilities**:
- **SQL Injection**  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
- **Directory Traversal**  

It sends payloads to the target URL (via query parameters) to detect whether the application may be vulnerable.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3**
- **requests** (install via `pip install requests`)

---

## Usage

1. **Run**:
   ```bash
   python3 vulnerability_scanner.py
   ```
2. **Provide** the target URL when prompted (e.g., `http://example.com/test`).

The script will make separate requests to the target with payloads typical of **SQL injection**, **XSS**, and **directory traversal** attacks, and prints a message if a vulnerability is potentially detected.

**Example**:
```
Welcome to the Vulnerability Scanner Framework.
Developer: Ronald Baker

Enter the target URL (e.g., http://example.com/test): http://localhost/test

[SQL Injection Test]
Potential SQL Injection vulnerability detected at: http://localhost/test

[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Test]
No XSS vulnerability detected.

[Directory Traversal Test]
No Directory Traversal vulnerability detected.
```

## Notes

- The **payloads** in the script are simplistic examples and might need to be expanded or customized for real-world testing.  
- The script checks for certain **keywords** (e.g., `syntax`, `error`, `root:`), which can produce **false positives** or **false negatives**. Adjust or extend these checks for more accurate results.  
- Always ensure you have **permission** to test the target web application.
