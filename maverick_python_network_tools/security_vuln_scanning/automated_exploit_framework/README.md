- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
- **Directory Traversal**

By specifying the target URL, you can test quickly for these common vulnerabilities.  

## Requirements

- **Python 3**
- **requests** library (install with `pip install requests`)

## Usage

1. **Run**:
   ```bash
   python3 automated_exploit_framework.py
   ```
2. **Choose** the exploit type from the menu:
   1. SQL Injection
   2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   3. Directory Traversal
3. **Provide** the target URL (e.g., `http://example.com/test`) when prompted.
4. The script attempts the attack and **prints the results**.
