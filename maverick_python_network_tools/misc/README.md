# Miscellaneous Tools

A few scripts that donâ€™t fit neatly into other categories, focusing on Wi-Fi signal mapping and monitoring.

## Subdirectories

- [wifi_signal_mapper/](./wifi_signal_mapper/)  
  Scans Wi-Fi networks and plots signal strength by location or grid, helping to visualize coverage.

- [wireless_signal_strength_monitor/](./wireless_signal_strength_monitor/)  
  Continuously measures Wi-Fi signal over time for debugging or site surveys.
