## Description

This script monitors the **signal strength** of nearby wireless networks in real-time using **scapy**.  
It captures 802.11 beacon and probe response frames, extracting details like:

- **SSID** (network name)  
- **BSSID** (access point MAC address)  
- **Signal Strength** (in dBm)  
- **Channel**

## Requirements

- **Python 3**
- **scapy** (`pip install scapy`)
- **Superuser privileges** (to capture wireless traffic)

## Usage

1. **Put** your wireless interface into **monitor mode** (e.g., `airmon-ng start wlan0` â†’ `wlan0mon`).
2. **Run** the script with `sudo`:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 wireless_signal_strength_monitor.py
   ```
3. **Provide** the wireless interface in monitor mode (e.g., `wlan0mon`) when prompted.
4. Press **Ctrl + C** to stop monitoring.

Example session:
