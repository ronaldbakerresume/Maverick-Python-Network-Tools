## Description

This script changes the MAC address of a specified network interface temporarily. It can either accept a user-specified MAC address or generate a random one.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Superuser privileges (via `sudo`)
- No additional Python libraries are requiredâ€”standard libraries only.

## Usage

1. Run with `sudo`:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 mac_address_spoofer.py
   ```
2. When prompted, specify:
   - The network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).
   - Whether to generate a random MAC address or provide one manually.
3. Confirm the MAC address has changed:
   - The script attempts to bring the interface down, apply the new MAC, then bring it up again.

Example session:
```
Welcome to the MAC Address Spoofer.
Developer: Ronald Baker
Company: Mavericks Umbrella LLC

Enter the network interface (e.g., 'eth0', 'wlan0'): eth0
Current MAC address of eth0: 00:11:22:33:44:55
Do you want to generate a random MAC address? (yes/no): yes
Changing MAC address of eth0 to 00:16:3e:23:a8:b2...
MAC address changed successfully to 00:16:3e:23:a8:b2.
```
