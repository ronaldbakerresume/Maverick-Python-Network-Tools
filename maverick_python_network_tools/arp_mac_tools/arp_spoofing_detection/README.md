## Description

This Python script detects ARP spoofing by monitoring ARP traffic and comparing IPâ€“MAC mappings. If any mapping changes unexpectedly, the script alerts you to a potential ARP spoofing attack on the network.

## Requirements

- Python 3  
- scapy (Install with: `pip install scapy`)

## Usage

1. Ensure superuser privileges by running with `sudo`:  
   ```bash
   sudo python3 arp_spoofing_detection.py
   ```
2. When prompted, enter the network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).  
3. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop monitoring at any time.

Example:
```bash
sudo python3 arp_spoofing_detection.py
