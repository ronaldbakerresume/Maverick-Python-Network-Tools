## Description

This script intercepts HTTPS connections and downgrades them to HTTP by modifying packets in transit.  
It is often used in penetration testing to demonstrate how attackers could intercept encrypted traffic if network routing is compromised.

## Requirements

- Python 3  
- **scapy** (`pip install scapy`)  
- **netfilterqueue** (`pip install NetfilterQueue`)  
- **Superuser privileges** (to hook into network traffic)  

You must also set up **iptables** rules to direct traffic into the **netfilter queue** used by this script.

## Usage

1. **Redirect traffic** to the netfilter queue (ID 0 in this script). For example:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
   sudo iptables -I INPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
   ```
   Adjust these rules to fit your environment.  

2. **Run**:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 ssl_strip_tool.py
   ```
3. When a redirect is encountered in the payload (e.g., `Location: https://...`), it is replaced with `http://...`.

Example terminal output:
