## Description

This script performs a Wi-Fi deauthentication attack for testing and educational purposes. It sends deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from a specified access point (AP).  

**Use this tool responsibly and with proper authorization.**

## Requirements

- Python 3  
- **scapy** (install with `pip install scapy`)  
- A **wireless interface in monitor mode** (e.g., `wlan0mon`)  
- **Superuser privileges** (to send raw packets)

## Usage

1. Put your wireless interface into **monitor mode** (e.g., `airmon-ng start wlan0` â†’ `wlan0mon`).  
2. Run the script with `sudo`:  
   ```bash
   sudo python3 wifi_deauth_attack_tool.py
   ```
3. Provide:
   - **Interface** (in monitor mode, e.g. `wlan0mon`)
   - **Target AP MAC address** (e.g. `00:11:22:33:44:55`)
   - (Optionally) **Client MAC address** if you want to target a specific device
   - **Number** of deauthentication packets to send

Example:
