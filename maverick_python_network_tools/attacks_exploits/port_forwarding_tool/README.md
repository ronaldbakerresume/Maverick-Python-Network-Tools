## Description

This script forwards traffic from one local port to another port or host. It listens on the specified source port and relays incoming data to the target host and port in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Standard library `socket` and `threading` (no extra installation required)

## Usage

1. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 port_forwarding_tool.py
   ```
2. Provide:
   - **Source port** to listen on (e.g., 8080)
   - **Destination host** (e.g., 127.0.0.1)
   - **Destination port** (e.g., 80)

Example:
```
Welcome to the Port Forwarding Tool.
Developer: Ronald Baker
Company: Mavericks Umbrella LLC

Enter the source port to listen on (e.g., 8080): 8080
Enter the destination host (e.g., 127.0.0.1): 127.0.0.1
Enter the destination port (e.g., 80): 80
Port forwarding service started on port 8080. Forwarding to 127.0.0.1:80.
Connection received from ('127.0.0.1', 53462)
```

When a client connects to `localhost:8080`, this tool will forward all traffic to `127.0.0.1:80`.
