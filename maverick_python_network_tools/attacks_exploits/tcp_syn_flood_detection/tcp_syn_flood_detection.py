This script detects potential TCP SYN flood attacks by monitoring network traffic.

Instructions:
1. Run the script with `sudo` (superuser privileges are required for packet capture).
2. Specify the network interface to monitor.
3. The script will alert when a potential SYN flood is detected.

Required Libraries:
- scapy (Install with `pip install scapy`)

Usage:
sudo python3 tcp_syn_flood_detection.py
