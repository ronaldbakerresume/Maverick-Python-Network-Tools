## Description

This script detects potential TCP SYN flood attacks by monitoring inbound SYN packets on a specified network interface. If the number of SYN packets from a single source IP exceeds a threshold within a given time interval, it raises an alert.

## Requirements

- Python 3  
- **scapy** (install with `pip install scapy`)
- **Superuser privileges** (run with `sudo` to capture packets)

## Usage

1. Run with `sudo`:  
   ```bash
   sudo python3 tcp_syn_flood_detection.py
   ```
2. Enter the **network interface** to monitor (e.g., `eth0` or `wlan0`).  
3. The script logs the timestamps of SYN packets from each source IP. If any IP exceeds the configured threshold within the monitoring interval, an alert is printed.

Example:
```
