## Description

This script simulates a Slowloris attack by opening multiple HTTP connections and sending partial requests, causing the target server to hold open sessions longer than usual.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Standard library `socket`, `threading`, `time` (no extra installation required)

## Usage

1. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 slowloris_attack_simulator.py
   ```
2. Provide:
   - **Target server** (domain or IP)
   - **Target port** (default is 80)
   - **Number of connections** to create

Example:
```
Welcome to the Slowloris Attack Simulation Tool.
Developer: Ronald Baker
Company: Mavericks Umbrella LLC

Enter the target server's domain or IP (e.g., example.com): example.com
Enter the target port (default: 80): 80
Enter the number of connections to create: 50

Connection established to example.com:80
...
Simulated 50 connections to example.com:80.
Press Ctrl+C to stop the simulation.
```

The script keeps the connections alive by sending partial requests periodically.
