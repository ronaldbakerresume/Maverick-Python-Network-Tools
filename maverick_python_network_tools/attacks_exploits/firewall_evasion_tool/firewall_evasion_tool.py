This script simulates different evasion techniques to test a firewall's behavior, including:
- Packet fragmentation
- Use of unusual protocols
- Irregular traffic rates

Instructions:
1. Run the script with `sudo` (superuser privileges are required for raw socket operations).
2. Enter the target IP address to simulate traffic.
3. Choose the evasion technique to simulate.
4. The script will send traffic and display results.

Required Libraries:
- scapy (Install with `pip install scapy`)

Usage:
sudo python3 firewall_evasion_tool.py
