## Description

This script shapes network traffic by introducing **delays**, **packet drops**, or **bandwidth limits** on a specified interface.  
It leverages **scapy** to capture packets and then manipulates them according to the userâ€™s chosen mode:

- **delay**: Introduce a fixed delay (in seconds) before sending each packet.  
- **drop**: Randomly drop packets with a specified probability (0 to 1).  
- **limit**: Limit bandwidth by calculating a delay based on packet size and the given kbps limit.

## Requirements

- **Python 3**
- **scapy** (`pip install scapy`)
- **Superuser privileges** (to intercept and send packets)

## Usage

1. **Run** with superuser privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 network_traffic_shaper.py
   ```
2. **Select** the network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`) to monitor.
3. **Choose** the traffic shaping mode:
   - `delay`
   - `drop`
   - `limit`
4. **Enter** the parameter for that mode:
   - Delay time (seconds)
   - Drop probability (`0` to `1`, e.g., `0.3`)
   - Bandwidth limit (kbps, e.g., `512`)

**Example session**:
```
Welcome to the Network Traffic Shaper.
Developer: Ronald Baker
Company: Mavericks Umbrella LLC

Enter the network interface to monitor (e.g., 'eth0', 'wlan0'): eth0
Enter traffic shaping mode ('delay', 'drop', 'limit'): drop
Enter drop probability (0 to 1, e.g., 0.3): 0.3
Applying traffic shaping mode 'drop' with parameter 0.3 on interface eth0.
```

Each packet passing through `eth0` has a 30% chance of being dropped.

Press **Ctrl + C** to stop.
